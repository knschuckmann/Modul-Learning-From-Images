# Learning From Images

This Repository is a collection of my assignments for one semester. 
All assignments have been developed by myself. 
Sometimes the students shared their results to compare them. 
You also will find some of the shared results in the directories. 


The main goal of this module (Learning from Images) was to learn how images are constructed and how we can retrieve the information out of them.

We used different technics to do so. One was calculating the k-means and creating a copy of an image. Another more sophisticated one was to estimate the Harris Corner algorithm. We also used Sift for academic purposes and could retrieve the keypoints in a straightforward and fast manner.

In every folder, you will find the exercise as well as my results.
