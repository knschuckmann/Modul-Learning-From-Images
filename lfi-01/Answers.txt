Question 1 (What are the problems of this clustering algorithm?):
for bigger K the algorithm gets slower. if the set has big outliers it is difficult to visualize them therefor there is a big problem with large outliers.

Question 2 (How can I improve the results?):
The used Loops are quite slow, better is allways converting the matrices into lists and using cython for a faster looping and therefore a faster calculation. Also a usage of value types is recomended, so one allways knows about the set of numbers one dealing with, e.g res = np.array[x.shape, np.uint8].
Typically a bigger number of clusters means a smaller MSE.
